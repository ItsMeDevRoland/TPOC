# TPOC
A Repository For TPOC Source Code
# Why Did You Turn TPOC into Open Source?
It Was An Idea Stuck Between My Head As After All TPOC is Being Built By Only 1 Person, And 1 Dude Which is Not 100 Percent
Fully Working With Me, And Thus I Have Concluded To Put it Out Open Source, So People Finally Edit the Game Itself And
Debug It
# Do We Have Permission To Add Mobs/Animals/NPC?
Well... It Is Base on How Useful it Is... If You Will Add, Let Say A Walking Mud... That Idea Will Be Trashed As
Nobody Want's A Walking Mud... If You Have Idea On Your Mind... Then Don't Be Afraid To Talk To Me Or Pull Up An Issue In The Issue Section
# How Do I Recoded Some Script/Redo Code...
Well... Redoing Code is... Hard... As TPOC is Pretty Much Hardcoded... Check For Yourself...
# Can I Edit Codes?
Edit Codes You Want, As Long As That Won't Break the Game Itself
# How Do I Edit The Game Without Using Construct 2?
Im Pretty Sure there Is No Way... As Construct 2 Is Needed, And For Sure You Need Construct 2 Business License...
Sooo.. I Really Can't Smuggle Some License To Ya'll As That is Illegal.... But You Can Try C2G Or Something *USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK*
# How Do I Post My Modified Version Of TPOC
Well... Create A Branch And Start A Pull Request
